## Self Evaluation Task 4:

Within our group, Talvin, Humza and I completed tasks 1 to 3 together. We decided to let Talvin take the role as group leader, and he proceeded to give us all the tasks. The task I was set was creating the Gantt chart, which was task 2. Humza was to prepare the training materials, task 1, and Talvin was to create the training event schedule, task 3. By separating the work into three parts, we efficiently worked our way through the tasks.

As a group, we decided to also help each other if we got stuck to make sure we could complete everything on time. With our tasks, we believed it would be best to hold back on the Gantt chart, as we didn’t know exactly what everything that needed to be made was. Individually we each came up with ideas of what would be in our schedule, which also included training materials. From there we came back together to decide what needed to be included and what didn’t. This helped me create the Gantt chart as I knew what we had to make, making it much more easier to schedule how to manage the workload.

Given more time, I would have made a more detailed document expanding on the Gantt chart which would explain in detail what each section needed which would help us keep focused and on track to completing everything by the deadline given.
