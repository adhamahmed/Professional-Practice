Team dynamics:
A very important aspect for a team to be successful is having good team dynamics. Team dynamics impact the course of a groups conduct and execution, this usually happen without the team considering it as they naturally work well together. The team dynamics are built by the essence of the teamâ€™s work, the personalities of the individuals in the team, the working relationships they have with the other member of their group and the surroundings in which the team works in. Team dynamics can be helpful because they can bring out the best in the team and also bring out the best in each person. If the team dynamics are not taken into consideration the performance of the team might not reach its potential resulting in the task not being up to a good standard.

In our task we obtained some team dynamics that made our work flow well. Our personality styles were compatible, meaning we all knew we were going work hard and deliver the targets that were set by our team leader. We had a good working environment and the tools and technology used were helpful in completing the work and communication with each other on a daily basis. Lastly, we all understood that we all different strengths and weaknesses, this was good because by identifying the qualities we could divide the work accordingly.

Team dynamics was hugely incorporated in successfully creating a group project. We managed to build a great environment for the members to work in, we did not have any arguments with each other because our personalities were very similar and we all knew what was expected of us. We also communicated clearly and bonded throughout the process. Our team working skills were also great as we wanted to help each other as much as possible. An example of this was when I did the task that was set to me by my team leader. The task was to list all the materials and activities that would be used for the training event. The team leader looked over my work and informed me that as well as listing the materials I should evidence them as well, this is so that the accessor can clearly see what we would be using for the event day. This was a hurdle for us to overcome and our only main issue in this task. The team leader asked what he wanted from me and I did it straight away. I did it without question because after reviewing the work I knew that this would improve the standard of the work. Both team leader and I both shared the belief that it is important for the work to be of high quality.

To conclude, I believe that the team dynamics that we all shared made this a very successful task. Our attitude to working well in a team created a good environment to do the work in. The tasks were all finished within the deadline by having a good team ethic we manged to overcome all the hurdles we faced.
